On the other hand, you will have a sight disadvantage if someone attacks you from the opposite direction. The use of that sight advantage should be kept in mind as it gives you a noticeable advantage over the AI. This is even more important in PvP as the enemy player can also use extended cross-hair moving for early detection. It is not seldom that the player who detects the enemy first will be the winner of the duel.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial/tutorial-extra/hijacking":{"id":"tutorial/tutorial-extra/hijacking","title":"Hijacking vehicles with EMP","description":"Video compilation (15 minutes) with setups for ambushing vehicles:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial/tutorial-extra/loot location":{"id":"tutorial/tutorial-extra/loot location","title":"Secret loot location\'s","description":"This guide discusses Secret Crates, Secret Cars, and The Tracker challenge.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial/tutorial-extra/rwr-weapon":{"id":"tutorial/tutorial-extra/rwr-weapon","title":"Best bang for the buck (weapon)","description":"Listing best weapons with a cheap price","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial/tutorial-extra/rwr-weapon2":{"id":"tutorial/tutorial-extra/rwr-weapon2","title":"Best bang regardless of buck (weapon)","description":"List the best weapons to choose","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
