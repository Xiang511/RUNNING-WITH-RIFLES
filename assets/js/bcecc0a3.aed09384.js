On the other hand, you will have a sight disadvantage if someone attacks you from the opposite direction. The use of that sight advantage should be kept in mind as it gives you a noticeable advantage over the AI. This is even more important in PvP as the enemy player can also use extended cross-hair moving for early detection. It is not seldom that the player who detects the enemy first will be the winner of the duel.","permalink":"/RUNNING-WITH-RIFLES/docs/tutorial/tutorial-basics/Vision"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
