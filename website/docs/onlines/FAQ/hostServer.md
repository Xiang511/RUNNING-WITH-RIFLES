# How to host a server

Hosting a multiplayer is as easy as setting up your own quickmatch game or campaign as shown previously, hitting “ESC” to get to the main menu, and then hitting the “Activate server” button.

1.Port number. **Please ensure** this port 1234 UDP (default port) is properly forwarded!

2.Your username. This will show up on the browser as the server name.

3.If you wish to make a public game, select yes. For private matches, select no.

4.Start the match.

5.Back to main menu.

:::tip

Once you hit “Start!” the server will be open for connections. If people are having issues connecting with your server, please check to make sure that the port is properly forwarded.

We will not go into details about how to do this. To get instructions on port forwarding, please do a Google search or check the manual of your router.
