1.	No abusive language or behavior

2.	No offensive usernames. Such accounts may be deleted without warning

3.	No intentional teamkilling of any kind (classical TK, revenge TK or bleeding-out TK to prevent the loss of said players equipment on death)

4.	No abusive spamming in chat

5.	No racism of any kind

6.	No profanity, verbal harrasment or offensive language directed at another player. In the event of an argument both players will be punished equally if it devolves into offensive remarks and name calling on both sides

7.	A player dropping his equipment after being killed makes it belong to the first person who picks it up. It is officially NOT his stuff anymore.

8.	Farming is tolerated. Exceptions: no ladder or AI navigation path blocking of any kind, no intentional inhibiting of team's advancement. Farming while your team is struggling to gain a foothold is also not welcome

9.	Suiciding important assets on purpose, such as repeatedly driving spawn and armory trucks into front lines or teamkilling radio towers, or other important emplacements.

10.	Locking down a player by stunning him constantly is also against the rules.

11.	Discovering and exploiting bugs (e.g. item duplication) is strictly prohibited and must be reported to the developers. If not complied with, account ban/deletion may follow.

12.	Creating an excessive amount of accounts. It's alright having a few accounts but 4 shouldn't be exceeded. Creating an excessive amount of accounts might result in a ban.

13.	Excessive usage/spamming of radio calls in order to intentionally create backlogs/grief may result in a kick or ban.

14.	Trade with other players at your own risk! Any loss or theft in the process won't be handled by moderators.

:::warning
Each of those points can lead to a warning, a temp ban, or a lifetime ban depending on the gravity of the act. A lifetime ban can happen without any warning.
