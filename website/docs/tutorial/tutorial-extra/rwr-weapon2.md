# Best bang regardless of buck (weapon)

List the best weapons to choose

## Intro

```@doom_hamster``` has made a great guide for weapons with a high value to cost ratio [see here..](./rwr-weapon), this guide is moreso weapons that I consider best in slot and/or fill a certain niche that no other weapon can, regardless of cost. The main selling points for the weapons presented are: how effective they are at killing enemies OR offering a unique capability that cannot be achieved with armoury weapons. 

This is a very biased list as it is built around only my personal experience with these weapons and what I believe to fit the above criteria (I'm sorry sniper enjoyers). There are undoubtedly weapons that could make this list but are omitted because I do not have enough experience with them, if you have any suggestions, let me know.

With that being said: If you are looking for a shiny new toy to house in your stash, you may want to consider one of the following...


## Bullet Based Weapon

`TKB`: A 30 round rifle that shoots 3 bullets at once

The reigning king of rifles since it's introduction. It's downsides of low accuracy and early fall-off start are made up for with sheer quantity of bullets. Great for anyone that simply wishes to turn their brain off and hose down infantry

`GILBOA DBR`: A 30 round rifle that shoots 2 bullets at once

The strongest rifle of history VS the strongest rifle of today, the DBR is the TKB's newest rival. Its firepower is cut by 1/3 compared to the TKB but features far better weapon handling and damage fall off. If you'd rather be able to reliably pick off targets at range without having to dump half your mag, you may prefer this rifle

`MICROGUN`: Heavy machine gun with backpack mounted ammo reserve

Despite being a fraction of the cost of the other weapons listed, this weapon holds its own and is extremely well suited for locking down frontlines and preventing infantry rushes. Manage your overheat well and you will have staying power comparable to that of a turret

`MK-47`: A supressed 30 round rifle

has stats comparable to the some of the best rifles despite being suppressed. Arguably the best in slot for supressed rifles

`GEN-12`: A supressed automatic 10 round shotgun

The GEN-12 has unparalleled close range burst damage, which is extremely handy for stealth weapons as getting rushed down by a vested enemy can be one of the greatest threats while on a stealth mission

`MP-7`: A secondary 30 round submachinegun

 A primary weapon disguised as a secondary, the MP-7 is the go-to for those who wish to replace their primary weapon with something a little more exotic... 

## Explosive Based Weapon

now this is what the guide was really made for. Bullet based weapons are a few steps above their armoury counterparts, but when it comes to grenade launchers, there are simply in a league of their own or have absolutely no counterpart. The power of arty in the palm of your hands...

`XM-25`: 4 round magazine fed airburst grenade launcher

The cheapest of what I'd consider a complete game changer. Fires a fast moving projectile that airbursts over your crosshair, this weapon is the answer to your trench infestation problem. Cover is now concealment, and brother, you can see through walls

`Javelin Anti-Personnel (APJ)`: handheld missile launcher with submunitions

While I'd consider it the weakest of the launchers listed here, it features the ability to fly completely over tall walls or entire buildings and drop munitions directly below, a trait only shared by the RWM and MRL but without the agonizingly long projectile flight time or setup

`RWM Mortar`: Handheld mortar

If you wish to turn yourself into a walking emplacement and click on enemy positions to watch them explode, the RWM is for you. Unlike the APJ, the RWM deals damage to armour and emplacements, allowing you to safely delete such threats from behind cover (this includes the ability to destroy key targets such as radio towers with enough perseverance). The 1.55x zoom also allows you to do so from a relatively safe distance, just dont get tunnel visioned

`MRL`: A Missile Launch Pad deploy + Targeting binoculars

Requiring setup time and 50 RP per missile, the MRL is much more specialized than the other weapons listed and can be treated more like a personal radio call. Best use cases include deleting enemy vehicles the moment they dare to intrude on your presence, calling in ordinance when comms are unavailable and flexing your wealth in front of everyone else. (The MRL also shares the ability to destroy radio towers akin to the RWM) 


`PF-98`: Reloadable rocket launcher

The SMAW surpasses all stock rocket launchers and the PF-98 surpasses the SMAW. If you have a burning hatred for vehicles, keep one of these in your pocket 
ㅤ

`Milkor`: 6 round semi-automatic grenade launcher

Despite having been dethroned as the king of grenade launchers as of late, it is still incomparably better than your stock faction options. Features the fastest fire rate of the hip-fired grenade launchers so if you prioritize being able to dump 6 grenades into a crowd of enemies in seconds, this is your weapon

`Chinalake` - HEDP: 4 round pump action grenade launcher

I would consider this a sidegrade to the milkor. Smaller magazine size and slower fire rate, but greater damage (120 to armor/2 vest layers) and a better firing arc. I can not understate how useful the higher firing arc is to this weapon, as it more than makes up for the downsides

`GM94` - Thermobaric: 4 round pump action grenade launcher

With a price only the unemployed can afford, this is the quintessential infantry remover. Deals 3 vest layers and has a massive 5m explosive radius, allowing you to efficiently convert meat into experience points. Caution; this weapon is just as deadly to allies and the user as it is to enemies, watch that friendly fire!

`QLZ87`: 15 round automatic super-heavy grenade launcher

Featuring zero ergonomics, this weapon sacrifices just about everything for firepower. Can be difficult to use effectively due to the required prone and massively slow movement speed, but when you manage to overcome those obstacles and find that perfect situation, you'll be painting the floor red 
ㅤ

`RG6`: 6 round semi-automatic grenade launcher

A high sustain grenade launcher thanks to the fact that It can reload just as fast as it shoots, meaning you can simply hold down LMB and press R to load a grenade each time you fire. Combined with the excellent 5m explosion radius AND an airburst to hit targets behind cover, I would argue that this is by far the best general purpose grenade launcher as of right now. Oh and I haven't even mentioned the alt fire, an extremely powerful shotgun that proves very useful when grenades risk friendly fire or enemies get a little too close for comfort. Despite this, its not the best in every situation as the slow fire rate limits your burst potential compared to faster firing GLs such as the milkor
