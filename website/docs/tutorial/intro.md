# Welcome to Running With Rifles

Running with Rifles is a top down/isometric shooter where you take on the role of a single soldier in the middle of a massive all out war between the Greenbelts, the Graycollars and the Brownpants. You are insignificant. You are no better than the man next to you. You are no god of war with regenerating health. You are just a soldier.

While at a first glance RWR seems like an easy game to play and understand, there is actually quite a lot of depth and complexity to the gameplay that can easily frustrate or confuse new players. However, after reading this handbook, you should have a much better understanding of RWR.
