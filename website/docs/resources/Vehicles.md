# Vehicles

Vehicles will spawn in the same place every time, except special vehicles which spawns in one of several random locations (to avoid predictable matches).

Destroyed vehicles will respawn (reappear undamaged) in their original location (except some special vehicles, which gets a new random location).

You can hijack most vehicles (as some are unhijackable such as the Legion) by entering at the driver's door. You will drag him out! Don't forget to stab him, before he stabs you!

Some vehicles allow passengers to shoot and use throwables from their seats, which allows various weapons to be used on otherwise unarmed vehicles.

Vehicles can only be damaged by explosives: mines, grenades, bazookas.

## Generic Vehicles

Special vehicles either provide utilities to their owning factions or are targets for destruction for various rewards. All special vehicles are unarmed.
