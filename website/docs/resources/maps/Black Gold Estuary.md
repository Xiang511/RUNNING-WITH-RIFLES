# Black Gold Estuary (map9)

![](./img/Map9labels.webp)

Bases to capture	13

**Black Gold Estuary** is a bigger desert theme assault map, where one team starts with 2 bases (Carrier and Beachhead) while the other faction defends their 11 bases from the invaders. 

This map is relatively vehicle-intense and non-linear. The areas between the beach camps don't offer much cover, so that the assaulter need to advance with care.
