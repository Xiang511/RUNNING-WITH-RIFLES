# Dry Enclave (map13_2)

![](./img/Map13blabels.webp)

Bases to capture	1

**Dry Enclave** is a three-faction king-of-the-hill version of Iron Enclave. The central water feature of Iron Enclave has been replaced with a Radar Tower, fixed defenses, and a light garrison of unaligned soldiers.

Many of the map features of Iron Enclave (armories, stashes) remain, even if not labelled on your map.
