Similar to most RPG, you gain experience while killing enemies. The higher the rank of the enemy, the more XP you gain.
Performing kill combos will give you an XP boost. You also lose some XP by getting killed / committing suicide or team killing.

## Scoring
Score is a statistic for online play. It is a simple Kills â€“ Deaths calculation and gives you a general idea of performance. If a server has Persistent Statistics, then your score along with the other stats shown by pressing the F1-key (default) will be saved over multiple matches and logins. None of these statistics have any influence on gameplay.

## Experience

***To view your XP/rank, hover over your character***. The number at the bottom shows your experience points (XP) and it starts from 0 at the beginning. On the right side is shown your current rank. You can also check your rank by keeping the F key (by default) pressed and right beyond your soldier your XP and RP is shown.

Your rank will dictate a few things:

- Capacity of equipment such as grenades, rockets, deployable weapons, etc.

- Ability to use certain weapons/equipment that are rank-restricted.

- Ability to use radio calls.

- Number of maximum squadmates possible (one per 1000 XP, up to a maximum of 10).

- Ability to take command of vehicles from allied AI or players. When your rank is greater than the rank of a soldier driving a vehicle, you can force the soldier to disembark by getting in the driver's side.

- The higher your rank, the better you retain AI soldiers in your squad and have higher priority in filling your squad, in regards to other human players.

The XP requirements for each rank can be referred in the table below

:::note
When just a weapon category is listed (like Assault rifles, Machineguns), it includes only the basic faction weaponry.
