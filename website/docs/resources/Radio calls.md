***Radio calls*** are powerful game elements that can turn the tide of a battle. They have to be used wisely as they can require a significant amount of resource points and can also provide a lot of collateral damage if not timed properly.

Press and hold the radio calls button ( `H` by default) to bring up your radio calls menu. Select a call by clicking on it or by pressing the number right next to the call symbol. Whatever you selected will then be dropped approximately where you had your crosshairs when you pressed the radio calls button.

Keep in mind that every radio call has a delay thus doesn't happen instantly.

Some maps has an ***anti-air emplacement*** that prevents the player from calling in paratroopers, airdrops or close air support, allowing only mortar strikes and artillery. The structure has map-wide range and needs to be destroyed in order to unlock the rest of the radio calls. The emplacement will then remain in its destroyed state indefinitely.

Enemy bases may also have a ***radio jammer*** that prevents the player and friendly AIs from using the radio. Unlike the anti-air, the jammer only affects the base itself, but is much more devastating since it completely strips the player off their radio ability.

:::note
You have to be at least Corporal (1000 XP) to get a radio device (will be added automatically to your HUD).

### Veterans Pack DLC
Players with the ***Veterans Pack DLC*** will have exclusive access to the light anti-armor ***VFS Call***, though any players can enter the VFS afterwards, regardless of whether they own the DLC.

DLC owners can also toggle on/off a ***Skin Pack*** option for their vehicles (applies to Humvee, Buggy, Main Battle Tank), applying a unique map-dependent camo pattern/decals to vehicles that prevents non-DLC owners from entering them.
