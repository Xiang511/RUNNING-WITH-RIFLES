RP or "Resource Points" are points you receive during the game while completing different tasks. Those RP can be used to buy different equipments at an armory or to use different radio calls. 

You can see how much RP you have by keeping the inventory key (Default `F` ) pressed to call the inventory.

It is displayed right below the XP information.
